a Flex CSS Gallery powered by JS

#TIL

More about Flexbox than ES6 in this lesson, but the js I did learn was on eventlistners which Wes seems to really be pushing (and I'm finding out is very powerful).

this lesson ended up being more routine and repetitive than somethign new, which is good for me to learn.  I was able to pause and write some things out myself.

what I don't understand in CSS is the .class > *:first-child 

I could use some help on that.
